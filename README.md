# Pomodoro Timer (React Version)
A clean and minimalist Pomodoro timer built from scratch with React to help improve focus and productivity. This project is a complete rewrite of my original vanilla JavaScript version, now leveraging modern React features like Hooks for state management and side effects.

## Features
Three Timer Modes: Switch between Pomodoro (25 min), Short Break (5 min), and Long Break (15 min).

Full Timer Controls: Start, pause, and reset functionality.

Background Safe: The timer remains accurate even when the browser tab is in the background.

Desktop Notifications: Receive a browser notification when a timer session ends.

Audio Alerts: Different sounds for work and break sessions.

Keyboard Controls: Press the Spacebar to play or pause the timer.

Custom UI: A custom-built dropdown menu and a frosted-glass aesthetic.

Component-Based Architecture: The UI is broken down into clean, reusable React components.

## Technologies Used
React 18: Built with functional components and Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef).

Vite: For a fast and modern development environment.

CSS3: For all styling and the frosted glass UI.
